# Damien Jinks CSS Portfolio

I have created this Portfolio as a way for potential employers to view my skills as a Web Developer. I have applied my knowledge of HTML and CSS to create a user friendly design containing a quick summary about me, links to my previous work, and links to get in touch with me. 

To create this website, I used HTML and CSS syntax to format a modern looking Portfolio which adapts to all screen sizes. 

By creating this Portfolio with the elements listed, I was able to gain a further understanding for how HTML and CSS work together to create the foundation for a webpage. 

Within the images of the HTML I have added alt tags to every image for accessbility requirements.
